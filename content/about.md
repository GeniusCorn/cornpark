My name is Corn
I am a student at GCU, majoring in Network Engineering with interest in modern Front-End developing.

I joined EMNOTE in 2017. EMNOTE is a pioneering company of emergency medicine education and research. I now serve as its senior vice president of technology.

I write some side projects and most of them are open source on GitHub.

You can reach me via E-mail. I played Dota 2 a lot and you may find me on Steam.
